That's a great and clean next step ‚Äî reusing the asg-runtime image as a base layer makes your builds faster, more stable, and avoids duplicating dependency installations.

Here‚Äôs what to consider and some concise best practices around your plan:
‚úÖ Your Dockerfile Looks Good

# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.3
FROM registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime

WORKDIR /app

COPY app.py .
COPY transforms ./transforms
COPY .env .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

This works well if asg-runtime image already includes all required runtime libraries (e.g. uvicorn, FastAPI, etc.) used by app.py.
‚úÖ Best Practices to Consider
1. Avoid copying .env into image if not needed at build time

Copying .env into the image bakes potentially sensitive configuration into the container. If your runtime environment (Kubernetes, Docker Compose, etc.) loads env vars separately, you can omit this line:

# COPY .env .  # Only if needed

2. Add a label for provenance

Helps track what the image contains:

LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source="https://gitlab.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-tech/sfdp-app"

3. Optional: Add a .dockerignore

To avoid copying unnecessary files (e.g. .git, local secrets):

__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
.git/

üß™ Quick Build Command

docker build -f Dockerfile -t sfdp-app:local .

‚úÖ How to Push asg-runtime to a Registry (if not yet done)

To allow the FROM registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/... line to work:

docker tag asg-runtime:latest registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime
docker push registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime

Make sure the GitLab container registry permissions are set correctly.
ü§ñ GitLab CI Pipeline for This App

If you want to automate this image build (from asg-runtime) via GitLab CI:

build-sfdp-app:
  stage: build
  image: docker:latest
  services:
    - docker:dind
  variables:
    DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1
  script:
    - docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" $CI_REGISTRY
    - docker pull registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime
    - docker build -t registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/sfdp-app:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA .
    - docker push registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/sfdp-app:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA

Would you like to extend this to support multiple build modes (e.g. dev, local, release), or generate a combined Docker Compose setup?
You said:
i see; i do have .dockerignore :-) my asg-runtime image was pushed ok by its CI but this did not include adding the tag. can this be the reson for this: 18:34:37 ~/asg-sfdp-med (main*) $ docker build  -t sfdp-med-img:local -f Dockerfile_from_img  .
STEP 1/7: FROM registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime
Trying to pull registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest...
Error: creating build container: initializing source docker://registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest: reading manifest latest in registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime: manifest unknown
(.venv)
ChatGPT said:

Yes, that error is caused by the missing latest tag on the asg-runtime image in your registry.

By default, this line in your Dockerfile:

FROM registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime

‚Ä¶is interpreted as:

FROM registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest

But if your CI pipeline pushed the image using only a Git commit SHA or a custom tag (e.g. :20240507), and didn't also tag and push it as :latest, then the latest tag doesn‚Äôt exist ‚Äî resulting in:

reading manifest latest in registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/...: manifest unknown

‚úÖ Fix Options
Option 1: Explicitly use a known tag

If the image exists with a known tag, update your Dockerfile:

FROM registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:20240507

(Replace 20240507 with the actual tag pushed by the CI.)
Option 2: Tag it as latest during CI build/push

Update the asg-runtime CI pipeline to include:

docker tag asg-runtime:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest
docker push registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest

You can do both:

docker tag asg-runtime:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
docker tag asg-runtime:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest
docker push registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
docker push registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest

Summary

    ‚úÖ Yes, the issue is due to the missing latest tag.

    üîß Either tag it explicitly in CI, or refer to the image with the specific tag that does exist.

    üßº Relying on latest in production is discouraged, but it's fine for dev images if consistently updated.

Would you like help making your CI script update the latest tag safely?
You said:
i understand. what i do not get is that in gitlab i can not find how the image was tagged. the only thing i see is this message on asg-runtime repo (see img) and also i see a repo named asg-runtime created in the "group" named  teadal-public-images. in the repo is see default readme.md. do you know where gitlab shows the images themselves?
ChatGPT said:

Yes ‚Äî in GitLab, container images are stored in the GitLab Container Registry, and you can view them via the GitLab UI only if:

    The registry is enabled for the project or group,

    The image was pushed to the registry associated with a specific project,

    And you are checking in the right project or group container registry view.

üîç To check your image tags in GitLab:

Since your image was pushed to registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime, and you mentioned there's a project named asg-runtime under the group teadal-public-images, here‚Äôs how to check:
1. Go to the project:

Navigate to
‚û°Ô∏è https://gitlab.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime
2. Open the Registry tab:

In the left sidebar:

    Expand Deploy (if it exists)

    Click on Container Registry

This page should show:

    A list of pushed images

    The tags for each image (e.g., 3d5823e0, latest, etc.)

    Timestamps for when they were pushed

If you don‚Äôt see the Container Registry tab:

    The GitLab Container Registry might be disabled for that project or group.

    You may not have permissions to view it.

    The image might have been pushed to a different project.

üõ†Ô∏è Tip: Enable container registry (if needed)

If you're an owner/maintainer of the project:

    Go to Settings > General > Visibility, project features, permissions

    Scroll to Repository, make sure Container Registry is enabled

Would you like help crafting the CI config to automatically tag and push latest in addition to commit-based tags?
You said:
indeed, i see it there: 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî the image is indeed there! But from the screenshot, we see that only one tag exists, and you‚Äôll need to click on asg-runtime to see which tag it is (likely the Git commit SHA like 3d5823e0, but not latest).

That‚Äôs why this fails:

Trying to pull .../asg-runtime:latest...
manifest unknown

Because :latest doesn‚Äôt exist.
‚úÖ How to fix this

You need to push a tag named latest in your CI pipeline. Here‚Äôs how:
‚úèÔ∏è Add this to your GitLab CI/CD .gitlab-ci.yml:

build-and-push:
  stage: build
  image: docker:latest
  services:
    - docker:dind
  variables:
    DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""
  script:
    - docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_JOB_TOKEN" "$CI_REGISTRY"
    - docker build -t "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA" .
    - docker tag "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA" "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest"
    - docker push "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA"
    - docker push "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest"

This will:

    Build and tag the image with both the commit SHA and latest

    Push both tags to the registry

üîÅ Alternative: Manual tagging (for now)

If you want to tag latest locally and push manually:

# If you have the image with the short SHA tag:
docker tag registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:3d5823e0 \
           registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest

docker push registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest

Then your downstream builds using:

FROM registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime

will work as expected.

Would you like help editing your existing CI pipeline YAML to include the above?

ChatGPT said:

Thanks ‚Äî your pipeline is nearly there! Let's tackle both parts:
‚úÖ 1. Why your image is not tagged as latest

Your pipeline currently pushes only a hardcoded tag (asg-runtime:0.0.1):

DOCKER_IMAGE: registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:0.0.1

So your build always does:

docker build -t registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/.../asg-runtime:0.0.1 .
docker push registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/.../asg-runtime:0.0.1

But the :latest tag is never created/pushed ‚Äî hence the downstream error.
‚úÖ Fix: Add the latest tag and push both

Here‚Äôs how to update the build-docker job:

build-docker:
  stage: build
  image: docker:latest
  services:
    - name: docker:dind
      alias: docker

  before_script: []
  script:
    - docker login -u "$DOCKER_USER_NAME" -p "$REGISTRY_PASSWORD" "https://registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com"
    - docker build -t $DOCKER_IMAGE .
    - docker tag $DOCKER_IMAGE registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest
    - docker push $DOCKER_IMAGE
    - docker push registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime:latest

You can also make it dynamic with CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA or CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME if you want versioned tags per commit.
‚úÖ 2. Where does the Python package go?

Your build-python step runs:

python -m build

Which produces dist/*.whl and .tar.gz.
But you're not pushing these artifacts anywhere in the release-python step ‚Äî you‚Äôre just printing ls dist/.
üß© If you want to publish to PyPI or a private registry, you must:

    Add secrets for username/password/token

    Use twine to push

For example, in the release-python job:

before_script:
  - python --version
  - pip install build twine
script:
  - python -m build
  - twine upload dist/* -u "$TWINE_USERNAME" -p "$TWINE_PASSWORD"

Replace credentials with project/group secrets.
‚úÖ Summary
Task	Status	Fix Needed?
Docker latest tag missing	‚ùå	Yes ‚Äì tag/push latest explicitly
Python package visibility	‚ö†Ô∏è	Yes ‚Äì use twine upload to publish
Container build works	‚úÖ	No change needed for 0.0.1

Would you like help wiring in version-based image tags (e.g., one tag per commit or branch)?
You said:
can i have package to go to the same place the image goes? 
ChatGPT said:

Ah ‚Äî great question. Short answer:

    No, Docker images and Python packages are stored in different registries in GitLab ‚Äî even if they‚Äôre hosted under the same GitLab group.

Let‚Äôs break it down:
üîπ Where Docker images go

You're currently pushing images to:

registry.teadal.ubiwhere.com/teadal-public-images/asg-runtime

This is GitLab‚Äôs Container Registry, tied to your project or group. It stores Docker layers, tags, etc.
üîπ Where Python packages can go

Python packages are handled by GitLab‚Äôs Package Registry ‚Äî a separate system designed to support:

    PyPI-style packages (.whl, .tar.gz)

    npm, Maven, NuGet, etc.

If you want to publish your .whl and .tar.gz files into GitLab‚Äôs Package Registry, you can do this using twine like so:
‚úÖ How to publish Python packages to GitLab Package Registry

In your .gitlab-ci.yml, add this to release-python:

release-python:
  stage: release
  image: python:3.12
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_TAG =~ /^v.*/
  before_script:
    - pip install build twine
  script:
    - python -m build
    - twine upload dist/* --repository-url https://gitlab.teadal.ubiwhere.com/api/v4/projects/$CI_PROJECT_ID/packages/pypi \
        -u __token__ -p "$CI_JOB_TOKEN"

This:

    Publishes to GitLab‚Äôs built-in Python registry

    Uses the $CI_JOB_TOKEN to authenticate

    Works only for tagged commits like v1.0.0

üîπ Accessing published packages

Once published, you or others can install with:

pip install --extra-index-url https://gitlab.teadal.ubiwhere.com/api/v4/projects/<project-id>/packages/pypi simple-package-name

Or add it in requirements.txt like:

--extra-index-url https://gitlab.teadal.ubiwhere.com/api/v4/projects/<project-id>/packages/pypi
simple-package-name

    ‚úÖ Tip: GitLab replaces <project-id> with your internal numeric ID, not the name/slug. You can find this in Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí General project ID.

Would you like me to rewrite your release-python job with this integrated?
