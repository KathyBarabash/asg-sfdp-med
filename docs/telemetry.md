Yes, if you implement Prometheus metrics posting, the style and goals of the evaluation shift in a few key ways:
‚úÖ Manual Stats vs Prometheus-Based Telemetry
Aspect	Manual JSON Stats (/service/stats)	Prometheus Metrics
Audience	Developer/researcher (local analysis)	Monitoring/ops team (cluster-wide view)
Data Format	Snapshot (manually retrieved)	Time series (automatically scraped)
Granularity	Cumulative counters only	Cumulative + per-second trends (via scrape intervals)
Collection	Manual via test script	Automatic (Prometheus scraping every N sec)
Analysis Tools	Custom script or CLI	Grafana dashboards, alerts, aggregation
Use Cases	Performance benchmarking, cache effectiveness	Live health monitoring, ops alerts, usage patterns
Overhead	None unless requested	Slight constant exposure cost (minimal)
üîç Implications for Your Evaluation

    Shift from local tests ‚Üí continuous observability:

        You‚Äôll no longer need to script 10 requests and compare pre/post counters.

        Instead, you‚Äôll monitor how request rate, latency, data served, etc. vary over time with different deployments or loads.

    Additional insights become available:

        Cache hit rate over time

        Time-series patterns (spikes in origin data fetches, processing time, etc.)

        Resource usage correlated with runtime metrics (thanks to Prometheus+NodeExporter)

    Easier team-wide visibility:

        Monitoring teams can build dashboards comparing different SFDP deployments.

        They can see whether response cache reduces network load, or which endpoints are most active.

üìå When Should You Switch?

    Stick with your current manual approach for local benchmarking and research writeups.

    Introduce Prometheus metrics when:

        You want system-wide visibility across Nodes and SFDPs.

        The monitoring/infra team is ready to receive metrics.

        You want to support long-term analytics or alerting (e.g., cache efficiency drops below 80%).

Let me know if you want help designing Prometheus metric names or labels to reflect things like SFDP ID, cache type, or transformation size.
